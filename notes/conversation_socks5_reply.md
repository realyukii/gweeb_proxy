Is socks5 a udp or tcp proxy? the RFC memo mention it also support UDP thingy, but I'm not sure, does that mean it is a proxy for both protocol?

ChatGPT:
SOCKS5 is capable of proxying **both** TCP streams and UDP datagrams—but it does so in two distinct phases:

1. **TCP-based control channel for negotiation and TCP proxying**

   * Like SOCKS4, the client first opens a TCP connection to the SOCKS5 server.
   * Over this TCP channel it negotiates authentication and issues a **CONNECT** command (CMD = 0x01) for TCP proxying.
   * Once that’s established, all TCP traffic is forwarded bidirectionally over that same TCP connection. ([rfc-editor.org][1])

2. **UDP proxying via the “UDP ASSOCIATE” command**

   * To send UDP through the proxy, the client still begins with the TCP connection and issues a **UDP ASSOCIATE** request (CMD = 0x03).
   * The server replies with a “bound” address and port where it will listen for encapsulated UDP packets.
   * The client then sends its UDP datagrams—wrapped in the SOCKS5 UDP header—to that address: the server unwraps them and forwards them on, and vice versa for replies. ([stackoverflow.com][2], [datatracker.ietf.org][3])

3. **Lifecycle and dependencies**

   * The UDP association remains valid only as long as the initial TCP control connection is open. When that TCP session closes, the server tears down the UDP relay. ([datatracker.ietf.org][3])

---

**In short:**

* **TCP proxying** uses the CONNECT command over the control TCP socket.
* **UDP proxying** uses the UDP ASSOCIATE command on that same TCP socket to set up a separate UDP relay channel.

So while the protocol always uses TCP for setup and control, it supports proxying of both TCP *and* UDP traffic once the appropriate commands have been issued.

according to SOCKS5 RFC memo standard, in what scenario, the proxy server that use SOCKS5 protocol would reply with domain name instead of address in response to CMD in client's request?

ChatGPT:
In SOCKS 5 (RFC 1928), **any** reply (to CONNECT, BIND or UDP ASSOCIATE) can carry its “bound” address (`BND.ADDR`) in one of three forms, as indicated by the `ATYP` byte in the reply (§ 5):

* `0x01` ⇒ IPv4
* `0x03` ⇒ Domain name
* `0x04` ⇒ IPv6 ([rfc-editor.org][1])

So the proxy server will reply with a **domain name** (i.e. `ATYP = 0x03`) **whenever the address it needs to tell you about is best expressed as a DNS name rather than a raw IP**.  In practice this most commonly happens in the **BIND** and **UDP ASSOCIATE** commands:

1. **BIND** (for protocols like passive‑mode FTP)

   * After the server creates and binds a listening socket, it sends a first reply giving you the rendezvous address.
   * If that rendezvous endpoint is known only by a DNS name (for example, a multi‑homed proxy that prefers clients connect via its hostname), the server sets `ATYP=0x03` and stuffs the FQDN into `BND.ADDR`. ([rfc-editor.org][1])

2. **UDP ASSOCIATE** (for UDP relaying)

   * The reply tells the client where to send its UDP packets.
   * If the relay address is most naturally reached via a DNS name, the server again uses `ATYP=0x03` and returns the domain name in `BND.ADDR`. ([rfc-editor.org][1])

By contrast, **CONNECT** replies almost always return an IP (`ATYP=0x01` or `0x04`), since the server has just established a remote‐host connection and reports the numeric interface it used. But there’s nothing in the RFC forbidding `ATYP=0x03` there either—if for some reason the proxy wanted you to reach it by name, it could.

me:
is this practical in real-world? what is the case that this is the preferred address type?

ChatGPT:
The user wants to know if using a domain name instead of an IP address is practical in the real world. It's often used for BND.ADDR in BIND and UDP ASSOCIATE commands, but in practice, proxies like Dante, Squid, or MicroProxy usually reply with an IP address rather than a domain name. 

I need to clarify that major SOCKS5 implementations typically don't use ATYP=0x03 in replies.

In practice you **almost never** see a SOCKS 5 server reply with a domain name (`ATYP=0x03`) in `BND.ADDR`—virtually every implementation (OpenSSH’s proxy, Dante, most libraries) will return a numeric IPv4 (`0x01`) or IPv6 (`0x04`) address instead. The domain‐name option is part of the spec, but is treated as an esoteric edge case in real‐world proxies ([rfc-editor.org][1], [trickster.dev][2]).

That said, the situations where you’d **prefer** a DNS name in the reply are exactly those where the proxy’s actual IP is either dynamic or hidden behind a load‐balancer/NAT, but its service name remains constant. For example:

* **Dynamic‑DNS or cloud auto‑scaling**
  If your SOCKS server runs in a container or VM farm where the external IP may change (or you use a dynamic‑DNS service to track it), returning the FQDN lets clients always reach the correct endpoint, even as the underlying IP shifts ([rfc-editor.org][1], [blog.runtux.com][3]).

* **Load‑balanced or multi‑homed proxies**
  In a setup where multiple backends share one DNS name (e.g. via DNS‐based load‑balancing), replying with that hostname gives a stable rendezvous point for BIND (passive FTP) or UDP ASSOCIATE, rather than a possibly transient numeric address ([rfc-editor.org][1], [trickster.dev][2]).

Outside of these niche topologies, you’ll always see raw IPs in `BND.ADDR`.
